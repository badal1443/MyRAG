**
I have some data stored in unity catalog in databricks, I wish to use Genie and RAG model to build chat app within databricks.

I want to understand step by step , How I

1) have a set of jira data 40 stories in total.
2) Use this data in train and test segments.
3) Use this train data to embed using DBTX embedding model.
4) Create vector data store in databricks. enable rest end point for it.
5) Once vector database is ready I want to use it with base LLM to answer questions.

Think step by step and lets confirm for each step ebfore proceeding to the next.

Great! Let's build a RAG-based chat application in Databricks step by step. I'll break this down into clear phases and we'll confirm each one before moving forward.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Jira Data (40 Stories)

First, let's establish how your data is structured and split it properly:

**Questions to confirm:**

1. **Current data location**: Is your Jira data already in Unity Catalog? If yes:
   - What's the catalog, schema, and table name?
   - What format is it in (Delta table, CSV, JSON)?

2. **Data structure**: What fields does each Jira story have? Typically:
   - Story ID
   - Title/Summary
   - Description
   - Status
   - Priority
   - Any other relevant fields?

3. **Train/Test split**: For 40 stories, I'd suggest:
   - **Training set**: 32 stories (80%)
   - **Test set**: 8 stories (20%)
   
   Does this split work for you, or do you have a different preference?

4. **Text preparation**: For embedding, we'll need to combine relevant fields (like title + description). Which fields should we use to create the text corpus for embedding?

**What we'll do in this step:**
- Load your Jira data from Unity Catalog
- Create a combined text field for embedding
- Split into train/test sets
- Save both sets back to Unity Catalog tables

Should we proceed with understanding your current data setup first?

---
I uploaded json data in catalog into schema:rag, and volume:ragvolume
----
Perfect! Now let's confirm the details about your data:

**Questions to clarify:**

1. **Volume path**: You mentioned the data is in a volume called `ragvolume` in the `rag` schema. 
   - What's the **catalog name**? (e.g., `main`, `dev`, `prod`, etc.)
   - What's the **exact file name** of your JSON file in the volume?
   - Full path would be: `/Volumes/<catalog_name>/rag/ragvolume/<filename>.json`

2. **JSON structure**: Can you share a sample of how one Jira story looks in your JSON? For example:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "JIRA-123",
     "summary": "...",
     "description": "...",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Next steps after loading**: Once we understand the structure, we'll:
   - Read the JSON file from the volume
   - Explore the data structure
   - Create a combined text field for embeddings
   - Split into train (32 stories) and test (8 stories) sets
   - Save as Delta tables in Unity Catalog for easier access

**Would you like to:**
- A) Share the catalog name and filename so we can write code to load and explore the data?
- B) Or would you prefer to first share a sample of the JSON structure so we can plan the field mapping?

Let me know and we'll proceed with Step 1!

---

Excellent! Now I have a clear picture of your data structure. Let me confirm the approach for Step 1:

## Step 1 Confirmation: Data Preparation

**What we'll do:**

1. **Load the JSON data** from `/Volumes/workspace/rag/ragvolume/rde_jira_sample_data.json`

2. **Create a text corpus** for embedding by combining:
   - `key` (e.g., "RDE-1")
   - `summary` 
   - `description`
   - `comments` (we'll concatenate all comment texts)
   
   The combined text might look like:
   ```
   "Story RDE-1: Implement user authentication system. Create a secure user authentication system with login, logout, and password reset functionality. This should include JWT token management and session handling. Comments: Core integration framework 70% complete. Testing with major third-party services."
   ```

3. **Split the data:**
   - Training set: 32 stories (80%)
   - Test set: 8 stories (20%)
   - We'll use random split with a fixed seed for reproducibility

4. **Save as Delta tables** in Unity Catalog:
   - `workspace.rag.jira_train` (training set)
   - `workspace.rag.jira_test` (test set)

**Questions before I create the code:**

1. Should we include all fields (key, issueType, status, fixVersion, productionReleaseDate) in the combined text, or just focus on key + summary + description + comments?

2. Are you planning to run this in a **Databricks notebook**? If yes, what cluster runtime are you using?

3. Do you want me to create a **Python notebook code** that you can copy and run?

Once you confirm, I'll create the complete code for Step 1!

---
Difference between these 2 typesof notebooks
---

Great question! Let me clarify the differences:

## Databricks Notebook vs Python Notebook

**Databricks Notebook:**
- Runs **inside Databricks workspace** (the platform you're already using)
- Has **direct access** to:
  - Unity Catalog (your data)
  - Databricks utilities (`dbutils`)
  - Spark clusters
  - MLflow
  - Vector Search
  - Pre-installed Databricks libraries
- Supports multiple languages: Python, SQL, Scala, R (can mix in same notebook using `%python`, `%sql` magic commands)
- **This is what you need for your RAG project** since you're working with Unity Catalog and Databricks services

**Python Notebook (like Jupyter):**
- Runs on **your local machine** or external servers
- Would need to:
  - Install Databricks SDK
  - Configure authentication credentials
  - Connect remotely to Databricks
- Typically used for local development/testing
- More complex setup for accessing Unity Catalog

---

## For Your Project:

**You should use a Databricks Notebook** because:
1. ✅ Direct access to your Unity Catalog volume
2. ✅ Built-in access to Databricks Foundation Models (DBRX embeddings)
3. ✅ Native Vector Search integration
4. ✅ Easy REST endpoint creation
5. ✅ No authentication setup needed

---

**So my question is:** Should I create code formatted for a **Databricks Notebook** that you'll create in your Databricks workspace? (This is the recommended approach)

Let me know and I'll proceed with Step 1 code!

Perfect! Let's proceed with **Step 1: Data Preparation in Databricks Notebook**.

I'll create the code for you to run in a Databricks notebook.

## Step 1 Code Ready! 

I've created a complete Databricks notebook for Step 1. Here's what it does:

### What the notebook contains (6 commands):

1. **Loads JSON data** from your Unity Catalog volume
2. **Creates text corpus** by combining key, summary, description, status, and comments into a single searchable text field
3. **Splits data** into train (32 stories, 80%) and test (8 stories, 20%) with random seed for reproducibility
4. **Converts to Spark DataFrames** for efficient processing
5. **Saves as Delta tables** in Unity Catalog:
   - `workspace.rag.jira_train`
   - `workspace.rag.jira_test`
6. **Verifies** the tables were created successfully

### How to use it:

1. In your Databricks workspace, create a new **Python notebook**
2. Copy the code from the artifact above
3. Attach it to a cluster (any runtime with DBR 13.3+ should work)
4. Run all cells sequentially

### Expected output:
- ✅ Two Delta tables in Unity Catalog
- ✅ Each row has a `text_corpus` field ready for embedding
- ✅ Verification of record counts

---

**Ready to proceed?** 

Once you run this notebook and confirm it works (you should see the success message with record counts), let me know and we'll move to **Step 2: Create Embeddings using DBRX**.

Any questions about Step 1 before you run it?

-------


Excellent! Now let's move to **Step 2: Create Embeddings using Databricks Foundation Model**.

## Step 2 Confirmation: Generate Embeddings

**What we'll do:**

1. **Use Databricks Foundation Model API** to generate embeddings
   - Model: `databricks-bge-large-en` (BGE is a popular embedding model available in Databricks)
   - Alternative: `databricks-gte-large-en` (GTE model)

2. **Load training data** from `workspace.rag.jira_train`

3. **Generate embeddings** for the `text_corpus` field of each story

4. **Save embeddings** back to a new Delta table:
   - `workspace.rag.jira_train_embeddings` (with original data + embedding vectors)

5. **Verify** the embeddings were created successfully

**Questions before creating the code:**

1. **Embedding model preference**: 
   - `databricks-bge-large-en` (1024 dimensions, good for general text)
   - `databricks-gte-large-en` (1024 dimensions, alternative option)
   - Do you have a preference, or should I use the default BGE model?

2. **Batch processing**: For 32 training records, we can process them in batches. Should we use:
   - Batch size of 10 records at a time? (recommended for stability)
   - Or process all at once?

3. **Test set embeddings**: Should we also create embeddings for the test set in this step, or focus only on training data for now?

Once you confirm, I'll create the Step 2 notebook code!

--------

Great question! Let me show you how to check available embedding models in your Databricks workspace.

I've created a notebook to check available models. Here's what to do:

## Quick Check Options:

### Option 1: Run the Notebook Above
Copy the code to a new Databricks notebook and run it. It will:
- List all available Foundation Model endpoints
- Check for specific embedding models
- Test if they work with a sample text

### Option 2: Check in Databricks UI (Faster)
1. In your Databricks workspace left sidebar, click **"Serving"** or **"Machine Learning"**
2. Look for **"Foundation Model APIs"** or **"Serving endpoints"**
3. You should see available models listed there
4. Look for embedding models (usually contain "embed", "bge", or "gte" in the name)

### Option 3: Quick Command (Simplest)
Run this single cell in any notebook:

```python
from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client
client = get_deploy_client("databricks")
endpoints = client.list_endpoints()
for e in endpoints:
    print(e['name'], "-", e.get('task', 'N/A'))
```

---

**After you check**, please let me know:
1. Which embedding models are available?
2. Or if Foundation Models need to be enabled?

Then I'll create Step 2 code with the correct model name for your workspace!


----------

Perfect! Let's proceed with **Step 2: Generate Embeddings**.

## Step 2 Code Ready!

I've created a complete notebook for generating embeddings. Here's what it does:

### What the notebook contains (10 commands):

1. **Initializes Foundation Model client** with `databricks-bge-large-en`
2. **Tests embedding generation** with a sample text to verify it works
3. **Loads training data** from `workspace.rag.jira_train`
4. **Creates batch processing function** for efficient embedding generation
5. **Generates embeddings** for all training records (processes in batches of 10)
6. **Adds embeddings** to the dataframe as a new column
7. **Saves to Unity Catalog** as `workspace.rag.jira_train_embeddings`
8. **Verifies** the saved table
9. **Generates embeddings for test data** too (saves to `workspace.rag.jira_test_embeddings`)
10. **Shows summary** of completed work

### Key Features:

- ✅ **Batch processing** to avoid rate limits (10 records at a time)
- ✅ **Error handling** to catch issues early
- ✅ **Processes both train AND test** datasets
- ✅ **1024-dimensional embeddings** (BGE Large model)
- ✅ **Progress tracking** for each batch

### Expected Output:

Two new Delta tables:
- `workspace.rag.jira_train_embeddings` (32 records with embeddings)
- `workspace.rag.jira_test_embeddings` (8 records with embeddings)

**How to run:**

1. Create a new Python notebook in Databricks
2. Copy the code from the artifact above
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. It should take about 1-2 minutes to complete

**Let me know when it's done**, and we'll proceed to **Step 3: Create Vector Search Index**!

Any questions about Step 2?
